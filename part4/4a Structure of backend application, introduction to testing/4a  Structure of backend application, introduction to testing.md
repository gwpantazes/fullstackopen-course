# Project Structure
Project structure is now becoming a bit more defined.
- Split code into different modules.
- Use Express routers to split express application logic further.
- App.js holds the domain specific app logic of setting up the express app
- Controllers set routers up as middleware to the greater express app

Express does not have strict Structure. Ruby on Rails does.
