# Part1b Javascript Exercises

- Continue working on the previous exercise application (`courseinfo`).
- Tip: structure of the props components receive may cause issues. Print `props` to console to see structure.

Modify the variable definitions of the App component to use objects and also refactor the application so that it still works.

# 1.4: course information step4
And then place the objects into an array. Modify the variable definitions of App into the following form and modify the other parts of the application accordingly.
NB at this point you can assume that there are always three items, so there is no need to go through the arrays using loops. We will come back to the topic of rendering components based on items in arrays with a more thorough exploration in the next part of the course.
However, do not pass different objects as separate props from the App component to the components Content and Total. Instead, pass them directly as an array.
