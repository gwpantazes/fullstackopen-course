# Introduction to React

[React library](https://reactjs.org/)
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

```bash
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ npmx create-react-app project-name
$ cd project-name
$ npm start # starts by default at http://localhost:3000
```

`App` is a component. We render that component to the `<div id="#root">` element.
Usually react apps don't put HTML directly into index.html. index.html on its own is empty.

Component is defined as a JS function. `() => (...)` is shorthand for `() => { return (...) }`
    - ES6 introduced arrow functions

Assign to const variables: `const App = ...`
